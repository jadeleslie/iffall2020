            </p>
            <P>
                According to Clark (2007), there are four main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible:
            </P>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A mild glow, near the horizon. These can be close to the limit of visibility, but can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Patches or surfaces that look like clouds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arcs curve across the sky.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rays are light and dark stripes across arcs, reaching upwards by various amounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coronas cover much of the sky and diverge from one point on it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Brekke (1994) also described some auroras as curtains.The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are also known as discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These forms are consistent with auroras’ being shaped by Earth’s magnetic field. The appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer’s position.

                colors and wavelengths of auroral light
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p><li>
                    Red: At its highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630 nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the “curtains”. Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
                </li></p>
                <p><li>
                    Green: At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630 nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7 nm emission (green) dominates. A fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0 nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen, a slow mechanism responsible for the graduality (0.7 s and 107 s respectively) of flaring and fading.
                </li></p>
                <p><li>
                    Blue: At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428 nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the “curtains”, show up at the highest levels of solar activity. The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
                </li></p>
                <p><li>
                    Ultraviolet: Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
                </li></p>
                <p><li>
                    Infrared: Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.
                </li></p>
                <p><li>
                    Yellow and pink are a mix of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are the primary colors of additive synthesis of colors, in theory, practically any color might be possible, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

                changes with time
            </p>
            <p>
                Auroras change with time. Over the night, they begin with glows and progress towards coronas, although they may not reach them. They tend to fade in the opposite order.
            </p>
            <p>
                At shorter time scales, auroras can change their appearances and intensity, sometimes so slowly as to be difficult to notice, and at other times rapidly down to the sub-second scale. The phenomenon of pulsating auroras is an example of intensity variations over short timescales, typically with periods of 2–20 seconds. This type of aurora is generally accompanied by decreasing peak emission heights of about 8 km for blue and green emissions and above average solar wind speeds (~ 500 km/s).

                aurora noise
            </p>
            <p>
                Aurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about 70 m (230 ft) above the Earth’s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.
